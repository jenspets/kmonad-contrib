# Keybard layout

This keyboard layout is based on the same layout I use for other keyboards. It is based on a 34-key layout using several layers and homerow modifiers. 

I use Colemak-DH ISO layout for the base layer, and with the extra ISO-key next to left shift for "z". 

# Keyboards 

Only one keyboard is configured right now, as my other keyboards has all functionaliy configured. 

## Zbook ISO

This is a laptop keyboard used with the HP Zbook laptop with an ISO keyboard. It does have a numpad, but I have not configured this.

# TODO

There are still a few things that I want to see if I can implement in the keymap:
- Caps word: Pressing both shifts will capitalize the next word
- Mouse keys and movements 
- Add nuhs-key to keymap. Currently, only mubs is defined

Some is only keymap tweask, but others might require a patch to KMonad.

# Origins 

The origin of this layout is from the keymap I use for my QMK and ZMK keyboards. The sources for those can be found here:
